That's my solution to stop tracker processes( tracker-miner-f, tracker-extract ) on my GNOME. I know, this solution is too silly, but i don't find better solution like removing tracker without miseries of fixing conflicts of dependencies.

If you know better way, then let me know, please.

<code>sudo sh install.sh</code>
<code>sudo systemctl enable tmeetc-killer</code>
